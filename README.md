# RL_dynamic_pricing_competition
The dynamic pricing competition is a free to join online competition organized by Haensel AMS and some partners: <br>https://dynamic-pricing-competition.com/ <br>
At Transavia we joined the competition to test Reinforcement Learning techniques and experiment in a sandbox-like environment. We have applied a DQNagent which uses a neural network for function approximation and has a discrete action space.

This repository contains some notebooks that were used to get started, <brb>
an experiment folder with submitted experiments to AML, <brb>
a competition folder with scripts that were used during the competition,
and some requirements that were used for this project environment.

Some files or functionality are left out as it is developed for Transavia's workflow. 
The function files like environment_functions.py and helper_functions.py are versioned for the experiments 
but not for the notebooks, it could therefore be the case that some notebooks are not runnable anymore.
